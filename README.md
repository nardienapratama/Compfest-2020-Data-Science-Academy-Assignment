# Compfest-2020-Data-Science-Academy-Assignment
This is a repository to show the work my team and I (3 people) have done for a Data Science Academy program in Indonesia called "Compfest".

The report has been done in collaboration with my friends. However, the python script has been fully my attempt at manipulating and analysing the data from the CSV file.
