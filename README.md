# Compfest-2020-Data-Science-Academy-Assignment
This is a repository to show the work my team and I (3 people) have done for a Data Science Academy program in Indonesia called "Compfest".

The python scripts - in data.py - have been fully my attempt at manipulating and analysing the data from the CSV file.

The report has been done in collaboration with my friends. Although the report is not in English, my python scripts have been used for some of the questions (screenshots in the document).
